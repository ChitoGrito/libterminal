CPR -- Cursor Position Report -- VT100 to Host

ESC [ Pn ; Pn R	
default value: 1

The CPR sequence reports the active position by means of the
parameters. This sequence has two parameter values, the first
specifying the line and the second specifying the column. The default
condition with no parameters present, or parameters of 0, is
equivalent to a cursor at home position.

The numbering of lines depends on the state of the Origin Mode (DECOM).

This control sequence is solicited by a device status report (DSR)
sent from the host.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUB -- Cursor Backward -- Host to VT100 and VT100 to Host

ESC [ Pn D	
default value: 1

The CUB sequence moves the active position to the left. The distance
moved is determined by the parameter. If the parameter value is zero
or one, the active position is moved one position to the left. If the
parameter value is n, the active position is moved n positions to the
left. If an attempt is made to move the cursor to the left of the left
margin, the cursor stops at the left margin. Editor Function

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUD -- Cursor Down -- Host to VT100 and VT100 to Host

ESC [ Pn B	
default value: 1

The CUD sequence moves the active position downward without altering
the column position. The number of lines moved is determined by the
parameter. If the parameter value is zero or one, the active position
is moved one line downward. If the parameter value is n, the active
position is moved n lines downward. In an attempt is made to move the
cursor below the bottom margin, the cursor stops at the bottom
margin. Editor Function

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUF -- Cursor Forward -- Host to VT100 and VT100 to Host

ESC [ Pn C	
default value: 1

The CUF sequence moves the active position to the right. The distance
moved is determined by the parameter. A parameter value of zero or one
moves the active position one position to the right. A parameter value
of n moves the active position n positions to the right. If an attempt
is made to move the cursor to the right of the right margin, the
cursor stops at the right margin. Editor Function

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUP -- Cursor Position

ESC [ Pn ; Pn H	
default value: 1

The CUP sequence moves the active position to the position specified
by the parameters. This sequence has two parameter values, the first
specifying the line position and the second specifying the column
position. A parameter value of zero or one for the first or second
parameter moves the active position to the first line or column in the
display, respectively. The default condition with no parameters
present is equivalent to a cursor to home action. In the VT100, this
control behaves identically with its format effector counterpart,
HVP. Editor Function

The numbering of lines depends on the state of the Origin Mode (DECOM).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUU -- Cursor Up -- Host to VT100 and VT100 to Host

ESC [ Pn A	
default value: 1

Moves the active position upward without altering the column
position. The number of lines moved is determined by the parameter. A
parameter value of zero or one moves the active position one line
upward. A parameter value of n moves the active position n lines
upward. If an attempt is made to move the cursor above the top margin,
the cursor stops at the top margin. Editor Function

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DA -- Device Attributes

ESC [ Pn c	
default value: 0

1. The host requests the VT100 to send a device attributes (DA)
   control sequence to identify itself by sending the DA control
   sequence with either no parameter or a parameter of 0.

2. Response to the request described above (VT100 to host) is
   generated by the VT100 as a DA control sequence with the numeric
   parameters as follows:

Option Present               Sequence Sent
--------------               -------------
No options                   ESC [?1;0c
Processor option (STP)       ESC [?1;1c
Advanced video option (AVO)  ESC [?1;2c
AVO and STP                  ESC [?1;3c
Graphics option (GPO)        ESC [?1;4c
GPO and STP                  ESC [?1;5c
GPO and AVO                  ESC [?1;6c
GPO, STP and AVO             ESC [?1;7c

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECALN -- Screen Alignment Display (DEC Private)

ESC # 8	 

This command fills the entire screen area with uppercase Es for screen
focus and alignment. This command is used by DEC manufacturing and
Field Service personnel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECANM -- ANSI/VT52 Mode (DEC Private)

This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode
(RM) control sequences. The reset state causes only VT52 compatible
escape sequences to be interpreted and executed. The set state causes
only ANSI "compatible" escape and control sequences to be interpreted
and executed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECARM -- Auto Repeat Mode (DEC Private)

This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode
(RM) control sequences. The reset state causes no keyboard keys to
auto-repeat. The set state causes certain keyboard keys to
auto-repeat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECAWM -- Autowrap Mode (DEC Private)

This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode
(RM) control sequences. The reset state causes any displayable
characters received when the cursor is at the right margin to replace
any previous characters there. The set state causes these characters
to advance to the start of the next line, doing a scroll up if
required and permitted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECCKM -- Cursor Keys Mode (DEC Private)

This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode
(RM) control sequences. This mode is only effective when the terminal
is in keypad application mode (see DECKPAM) and the ANSI/VT52 mode
(DECANM) is set (see DECANM). Under these conditions, if the cursor
key mode is reset, the four cursor function keys will send ANSI cursor
control commands. If cursor key mode is set, the four cursor function
keys will send application functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECCOLM -- Column Mode (DEC Private)

This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode
(RM) control sequences. The reset state causes a maximum of 80 columns
on the screen. The set state causes a maximum of 132 columns on the
screen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECDHL -- Double Height Line (DEC Private)

Top Half: ESC # 3	 
Bottom Half: ESC # 4
	 
These sequences cause the line containing the active position to
become the top or bottom half of a double-height double-width
line. The sequences must be used in pairs on adjacent lines and the
same character output must be sent to both lines to form full
double-height characters. If the line was single-width single-height,
all characters to the right of the center of the screen are lost. The
cursor remains over the same character position unless it would be to
the right of the right margin, in which case it is moved to the right
margin.

NOTE: The use of double-width characters reduces the number of
characters per line by half.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECDWL -- Double-Width Line (DEC Private)

ESC # 6	 

This causes the line that contains the active position to become
double-width single-height. If the line was single-width
single-height, all characters to the right of the screen are lost. The
cursor remains over the same character position unless it would be to
the right of the right margin, in which case, it is moved to the right
margin.

NOTE: The use of double-width characters reduces the number of
characters per line by half.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECID -- Identify Terminal (DEC Private)

ESC Z

This sequence causes the same response as the ANSI device attributes
(DA). This sequence will not be supported in future DEC terminals,
therefore, DA should be used by any new software.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECINLM -- Interlace Mode (DEC Private)

This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode
(RM) control sequences. The reset state (non-interlace) causes the
video processor to display 240 scan lines per frame. The set state
(interlace) causes the video processor to display 480 scan lines per
frame. There is no increase in character resolution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECKPAM -- Keypad Application Mode (DEC Private)

ESC =	 

The auxiliary keypad keys will transmit control sequences as defined
in Tables 3-7 and 3-8.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECKPNM -- Keypad Numeric Mode (DEC Private)

ESC >	 

The auxiliary keypad keys will send ASCII codes corresponding to the
characters engraved on the keys.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECLL -- Load LEDS (DEC Private)

ESC [ Ps q
default value: 0

Load the four programmable LEDs on the keyboard according to the
parameter(s).

Parameter  Parameter Meaning
---------  -----------------
0          Clear LEDs L1 through L4
1          Light L1
2          Light L2
3          Light L3
4          Light L4

LED numbers are indicated on the keyboard.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECOM -- Origin Mode (DEC Private)

This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode
(RM) control sequences. The reset state causes the origin to be at the
upper-left character position on the screen. Line and column numbers
are, therefore, independent of current margin settings. The cursor may
be positioned outside the margins with a cursor position (CUP) or
horizontal and vertical position (HVP) control.

The set state causes the origin to be at the upper-left character
position within the margins. Line and column numbers are therefore
relative to the current margin settings. The cursor is not allowed to
be positioned outside the margins.

The cursor is moved to the new home position when this mode is set or
reset.

Lines and columns are numbered consecutively, with the origin being
line 1, column 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECRC -- Restore Cursor (DEC Private)

ESC 8	 

This sequence causes the previously saved cursor position, graphic
rendition, and character set to be restored.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECREPTPARM -- Report Terminal Parameters

ESC [ <sol>; <par>; <nbits>; <xspeed>; <rspeed>; <clkmul>; <flags> x	 

These sequence parameters are explained below in the DECREQTPARM sequence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECREQTPARM -- Request Terminal Parameters

ESC [ <sol> x	 

The sequence DECREPTPARM is sent by the terminal controller to notify
the host of the status of selected terminal parameters. The status
sequence may be sent when requested by the host or at the terminal's
discretion. DECREPTPARM is sent upon receipt of a DECREQTPARM. On
power-up or reset, the VT100 is inhibited from sending unsolicited
reports.

The meanings of the sequence parameters are:

Parameter	Value	Meaning

<sol>               0 or none  This message is a request (DECREQTPARM) and the 
                               terminal will be allowed to send unsolicited 
                               reports. (Unsolicited reports are sent when the

                               number.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECSC -- Save Cursor (DEC Private)

ESC 7

This sequence causes the cursor position, graphic rendition, and
character set to be saved. (See DECRC).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECSCLM -- Scrolling Mode (DEC Private)

This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode
(RM) control sequences. The reset state causes scrolls to "jump"
instantaneously. The set state causes scrolls to be "smooth" at a
maximum rate of six lines per second.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECSCNM -- Screen Mode (DEC Private)

This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode
(RM) control sequences. The reset state causes the screen to be black
with white characters. The set state causes the screen to be white
with black characters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECSTBM -- Set Top and Bottom Margins (DEC Private)

ESC [ Pn; Pn r
default values: see below

This sequence sets the top and bottom margins to define the scrolling
region. The first parameter is the line number of the first line in
the scrolling region; the second parameter is the line number of the
bottom line in the scrolling region. Default is the entire screen (no
margins). The minimum size of the scrolling region allowed is two
lines, i.e., the top margin must be less than the bottom margin. The
cursor is placed in the home position (see Origin Mode DECOM).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECSWL -- Single-width Line (DEC Private)

ESC # 5	 

This causes the line which contains the active position to become
single-width single-height. The cursor remains on the same character
position. This is the default condition for all new lines on the
screen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DECTST -- Invoke Confidence Test

ESC [ 2 ; Ps y	 

Ps is the parameter indicating the test to be done. Ps is computed by
taking the weight indicated for each desired test and adding them
together. If Ps is 0, no test is performed but the VT100 is reset.

Test -> Weight
Power up self-test (ROM check sum, RAM, NVR keyboard and AVO if installed) -> 1
Data Loop Back -> 2 (loop back connector required)
EIA modem control test -> 4 (loop back connector required)
Repeat Selected Test(s) indefinitely (until failure or power off) -> 8

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSR -- Device Status Report

ESC [ Ps n
default value: 0

Requests and reports the general status of the VT100 according to the
following parameter(s).

Parameter  Parameter Meaning
---------  -----------------
0          Response from VT100 -- Ready, No malfunctions detected (default)
3          Response from VT100 -- Malfunction -- retry
5          Command from host -- Please report status (using a DSR control 
           sequence)
6          Command from host -- Please report active position (using a CPR 
           control sequence)

DSR with a parameter value of 0 or 3 is always sent as a response to a
requesting DSR with a parameter value of 5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ED -- Erase In Display

ESC [ Ps J
default value: 0

This sequence erases some or all of the characters in the display
according to the parameter. Any complete line erased by this sequence
will return that line to single width mode. Editor Function

Parameter  Parameter Meaning
---------  -----------------
0          Erase from the active position to the end of the screen, inclusive 
           (default)
1          Erase from start of the screen to the active position, inclusive
2          Erase all of the display -- all lines are erased, changed to 
           single-width, and the cursor does not move.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EL -- Erase In Line

ESC [ Ps K
default value: 0

Erases some or all characters in the active line according to the
parameter. Editor Function

Parameter  Parameter Meaning
---------  -----------------
0          Erase from the active position to the end of the line, inclusive 
           (default)
1          Erase from the start of the screen to the active position, inclusive
2          Erase all of the line, inclusive

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTS -- Horizontal Tabulation Set

ESC H	 

Set one horizontal stop at the active position. Format Effector

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HVP -- Horizontal and Vertical Position

ESC [ Pn ; Pn f
default value: 1

Moves the active position to the position specified by the
parameters. This sequence has two parameter values, the first
specifying the line position and the second specifying the column. A
parameter value of either zero or one causes the active position to
move to the first line or column in the display, respectively. The
default condition with no parameters present moves the active position
to the home position. In the VT100, this control behaves identically
with its editor function counterpart, CUP. The numbering of lines and
columns depends on the reset or set state of the origin mode
(DECOM). Format Effector

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IND -- Index

ESC D	 

This sequence causes the active position to move downward one line
without changing the column position. If the active position is at the
bottom margin, a scroll up is performed. Format Effector

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LNM -- Line Feed/New Line Mode

This is a parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode (RM)
control sequences. The reset state causes the interpretation of the
line feed (LF), defined in ANSI Standard X3.4-1977, to imply only
vertical movement of the active position and causes the RETURN key
(CR) to send the single code CR. The set state causes the LF to imply
movement to the first position of the following line and causes the
RETURN key to send the two codes (CR, LF). This is the New Line (NL)
option.

This mode does not affect the index (IND), or next line (NEL) format effectors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEL -- Next Line

ESC E	 

This sequence causes the active position to move to the first position
on the next line downward. If the active position is at the bottom
margin, a scroll up is performed. Format Effector

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RI -- Reverse Index

ESC M	 

Move the active position to the same horizontal position on the
preceding line. If the active position is at the top margin, a scroll
down is performed. Format Effector

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RIS -- Reset To Initial State

ESC c	 

Reset the VT100 to its initial state, i.e., the state it has after it
is powered on. This also causes the execution of the power-up
self-test and signal INIT H to be asserted briefly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RM -- Reset Mode

ESC [ Ps ; Ps ; . . . ; Ps l
default value: none

Resets one or more VT100 modes as specified by each selective
parameter in the parameter string. Each mode to be reset is specified
by a separate parameter. [See Set Mode (SM) control sequence]. (See
Modes following this section).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCS -- Select Character Set

The appropriate G0 and G1 character sets are designated from one of
the five possible character sets. The G0 and G1 sets are invoked by
the codes SI and SO (shift in and shift out) respectively.

G0 Sets Sequence  G1 Sets Sequence  Meaning
----------------  ----------------  -------
ESC ( A           ESC ) A           United Kingdom Set
ESC ( B           ESC ) B           ASCII Set
ESC ( 0           ESC ) 0           Special Graphics
ESC ( 1           ESC ) 1           Alternate Character ROM Standard Character 
                                    Set
ESC ( 2           ESC ) 2           Alternate Character ROM Special Graphics

The United Kingdom and ASCII sets conform to the "ISO international
register of character sets to be used with escape sequences". The
other sets are private character sets. Special graphics means that the
graphic characters for the codes 1378 to 1768 are replaced with other
characters. The specified character set will be used until another SCS
is received.

NOTE: Additional information concerning the SCS escape sequence may be
obtained in ANSI standard X3.41-1974.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SGR -- Select Graphic Rendition

ESC [ Ps ; . . . ; Ps m	
default value: 0

Invoke the graphic rendition specified by the parameter(s). All
following characters transmitted to the VT100 are rendered according
to the parameter(s) until the next occurrence of SGR. Format Effector

Parameter  Parameter Meaning
---------  -----------------
0          Attributes off
1          Bold or increased intensity
4          Underscore
5          Blink
7          Negative (reverse) image
All other parameter values are ignored.

With the Advanced Video Option, only one type of character attribute
is possible as determined by the cursor selection; in that case
specifying either the underscore or the reverse attribute will
activate the currently selected attribute. (See cursor selection in
Chapter 1).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SM -- Set Mode

ESC [ Ps ; . . . ; Ps h	
default value: none

Causes one or more modes to be set within the VT100 as specified by
each selective parameter in the parameter string. Each mode to be set
is specified by a separate parameter. A mode is considered set until
it is reset by a reset mode (RM) control sequence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TBC -- Tabulation Clear

ESC [ Ps g
default value: 0

Parameter  Parameter Meaning
---------  -----------------
0          Clear the horizontal tab stop at the active position (the default
           case).
3          Clear all horizontal tab stops.
Any other parameter values are ignored. Format Effector

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Valid VT52 Mode Control Sequences
=================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cursor Up

ESC A	 

Move the active position upward one position without altering the
horizontal position. If an attempt is made to move the cursor above
the top margin, the cursor stops at the top margin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cursor Down

ESC B	 

Move the active position downward one position without altering the
horizontal position. If an attempt is made to move the cursor below
the bottom margin, the cursor stops at the bottom margin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cursor Right

ESC C	 

Move the active position to the right. If an attempt is made to move
the cursor to the right of the right margin, the cursor stops at the
right margin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cursor Left

ESC D	 

Move the active position one position to the left. If an attempt is
made to move the cursor to the left of the left margin, the cursor
stops at the left margin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter Graphics Mode

ESC F	 

Causes the special graphics character set to be used.

NOTE: The special graphics characters in the VT100 are different from
those in the VT52.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exit Graphics Mode

ESC G	 

This sequence causes the standard ASCII character set to be used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cursor to Home

ESC H	 

Move the cursor to the home position.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reverse Line Feed

ESC I	 

Move the active position upward one position without altering the
column position. If the active position is at the top margin, a scroll
down is performed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Erase to End of Screen

ESC J	 

Erase all characters from the active position to the end of the
screen. The active position is not changed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Erase to End of Line

ESC K	 

Erase all characters from the active position to the end of the
current line. The active position is not changed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Direct Cursor Address

ESC Y line column	 

Move the cursor to the specified line and column. The line and column
numbers are sent as ASCII codes whose values are the number plus 0378;
e.g., 0408 refers to the first line or column, 0508 refers to the
eighth line or column, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identify

ESC Z	 

This sequence causes the terminal to send its identifier escape
sequence to the host. This sequence is:

ESC / Z

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter Alternate Keypad Mode

ESC =	 

The optional auxiliary keypad keys will send unique identifiable
escape sequences for use by applications programs.

NOTE: Information regarding options must be obtained in ANSI mode,
using the device attributes (DA) control sequences.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exit Alternate Keypad Mode

ESC >	 

The optional auxiliary keypad keys send the ASCII codes for the
functions or characters engraved on the key.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter ANSI Mode

ESC <	 

All subsequent escape sequences will be interpreted according to ANSI
Standards X3.64-1977 and X3.41-1974. The VT52 escape sequence designed
in this section will not be recognized.
